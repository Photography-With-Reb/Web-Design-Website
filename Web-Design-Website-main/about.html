      <h2>About Me and My Journey</h2>
      <p>Hi, I’m Reb — a web developer and mum of two energetic boys. I made a career change to follow my passion for tech, creativity, and problem-solving.

I’ve always loved building things and finding smart solutions, and web development allows me to do just that — blending logic and design to create websites that are both functional and beautiful.

My background has taught me how to stay organised, think critically, and adapt quickly — all skills I bring to every project. Whether it’s coding a new feature or designing a clean user experience, I’m all in.

I’m excited to keep growing in this space and turning ideas into digital reality.
